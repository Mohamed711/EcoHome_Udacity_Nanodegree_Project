      "### Solar Generation Potential\n",
      "- **Peak Solar Generation**: The solar irradiance is expected to peak between **9 AM and 2 PM**. The highest solar output is projected at:\n",
      "  - **10 AM**: 439 W/m²\n",
      "  - **11 AM**: 457 W/m²\n",
      "  - **12 PM**: 399 W/m²\n",
      "  - **1 PM**: 445 W/m²\n",

      "### Electricity Pricing\n",
      "- **Time-of-Use Rates**:\n",
      "  - **Peak Rates (6 AM - 6 PM)**: $0.22 per kWh\n",
      "  - **Off-Peak Rates (12 AM - 6 AM, 9 PM - 12 AM)**: $0.15 per kWh\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "1. **Charge During Off-Peak Hours**: To minimize costs, charge your electric car during off-peak hours:\n",
      "   - **Best Time**: Start charging at **10 PM** on October 3rd (off-peak) and continue until **6 AM** on October 4th (off-peak).\n",
      "   - **Cost**: $0.15 per kWh.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Maximize Solar Usage**: If you prefer to charge during the day to utilize solar power:\n",
      "   - **Best Time**: Charge between **10 AM and 2 PM** when solar generation is at its peak.\n",
      "   - **Cost**: $0.22 per kWh.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "- **For Cost Efficiency**: Charge overnight starting at **10 PM** on October 3rd.\n",
      "- **For Solar Utilization**: Charge during the day, ideally between **10 AM and 2 PM**.\n",
